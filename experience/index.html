          <h3>DAQ</h3>
          <a>
            Objective: Design and develop a custom DAQ PCB capable of accurately reading eight current-output pressure transducers, with an emphasis on low noise, high resolution, and reliable data acquisition for real-time analysis.
          <a>
          <a>
            <br><br>Outcomes: We were able to gain reliable pressure reading allowing the Vesper Rocket project to continue onto throttling a liquid bi propellant rocket.
          </a>
          <a>
            <br><br>Technical Details: The boards used an STM32F103 chip with shunt resistors to convert the current loop into a voltage diffrence the ADC's could read. The entirity of the board was designed by me on KiCad and ran through spice models. It was sent to JLCPCB to get manufactured and tested in house.
